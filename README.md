## Overview

This project provides a curated collection of skills focused on building production-ready AI agent applications. Each skill is a comprehensive guide that covers key facts, best practices, code examples, and architectural patterns for specific technologies.

## Motivation

This collection was created to provide up-to-date guidance and resources for modern web development and AI integration. The primary focus areas include:

- **Next.js 16 Migration** - Comprehensive documentation on upgrading to Next.js 16, including breaking changes, Turbopack bundler, and async request APIs
- **Prisma ORM v7** - In-depth coverage of Prisma's latest version with ESM-only support, driver adapters, and modern database patterns
- **Upstash Vector Database on Vercel** - Production-ready guidance for semantic search and AI applications using serverless vector databases

These tools form the foundation of modern full-stack applications and represent the current best practices for building scalable, AI-powered systems.

## Understanding Agent Skills

Agent Skills are reusable components that extend the capabilities of AI agents in VS Code and other development environments. They enable agents to perform specific tasks by providing structured knowledge about tools, frameworks, and best practices.

**How to Use These Skills:**

These skills are designed to be referenced by AI agents as they work on projects. When an agent encounters a task related to Next.js, Prisma, AI SDK, or vector databases, it can consult the relevant skill to understand best practices, configuration options, and implementation patterns. Each skill acts as a knowledge base that helps agents make informed decisions and generate production-ready code.

You can leverage these skills in several ways:

1. **In VS Code Copilot** - Reference these skills when working on agent-related tasks to get contextual guidance
2. **In Custom Agents** - Build your own agents that can reference these skills for specialized knowledge
3. **Documentation Reference** - Use as comprehensive guides when developing applications with these technologies
4. **Team Knowledge Base** - Share within your team to ensure consistent implementation patterns and best practices

The skills are structured to be both human-readable and machine-parseable, making them ideal for both developer reference and AI agent consumption.

## Installation

### Installing Skills in VS Code

To use these AI Agent Skills with VS Code Copilot, follow these steps:

> **📖 For detailed installation instructions, troubleshooting, and advanced setup, see [INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md)**

#### Option 1: Clone the Repository (Recommended)

1. **Clone this repository** to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gocallum/nextjs16-agent-skills.git
   ```

2. **Configure VS Code to use the skills:**
   - Open VS Code Settings (File → Preferences → Settings or `Cmd/Ctrl + ,`)
   - Search for "GitHub Copilot Agent Skills"
   - Add the path to the `.claude` directory from this repository

3. **Alternative: Use VS Code Settings JSON**
   - Open VS Code Settings JSON (`Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P` → "Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)")
